Possible additional features:
* give some feedback on cumulative error (e.g. RMS of per-beat error)
* have some "reward bands" near the target mark
* add audio cues
* let the visual metronome marks fade out (or maybe some kind of cross-fade from visual to aural)
* rhythm (i.e. not just a completely steady beat)
* alternate input methods (e.g. microphone)
* melody (requires microphone input, probably)
* synch to music

Impact will be low for all of these features, since the intended audience is
one person no matter what. So leave that column out in the analysis below.
